# Project-1-Proposal

A new Repo on your Personal Github Page named for your Project
A detailed ReadMe file that explains your project, what you want to accomplish and what you expect your challenges to be
A Wireframe of your design
A successful API call through Thunderclient if you using an API
Pseudocode of your Gameâ€™s logic if creating a Game

My goal is to use an API in order to create ranking system. This will grab information such as a name and picture from an API and display them to the user. The user will then be prompted to choose between the two items that the API provides them with. This will then display these items on a bracket and prompt a new decision. This will continue until the bracket is filled and will have the player choose which item is the best one by one.
