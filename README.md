# Project-1-Proposal

My goal is to use an API in order to create ranking system. This will grab information such as a name and picture from the Superhero API and display them to the user. The user will then be prompted to choose between the two superheroes that the API provides them with, and the winner will move up in the bracket displayed below. This will repeat and continue until the bracket is filled and will have the player choose which superhero is their favorite one by one.

Potential challenges for this project will be grabbing the random character from the API as this will help to finally make sure I completely understand how to use APIs. Another challenge will be designing the page. The bracket above seems like it could be challenging to incorporate into the website both because of its shape and size. I might have to create a miniature display of it that you can click on to enlarge it in order to make the site look professional.
